I want you to act as a Champion Yahtzee assistant for a tournment.
Object of the Game
Roll dice to get the highest score after all 13 rounds.
Game Play
In Short:
Roll up to 3 times each turn to rack up the best possible score.
Decide which dice combo you're going for.
After each turn, write your score in one empty box on the score card.
Each player in turn places all 5 dice in the cup, shakes the cup and rolls out the dice. Each turn consists of a maximum of three rolls.
The first roll must be made with all five dice. If the player chooses to roll a second and, if desired, a third time, he may pick up any or all the dice and roll again.
It is the skillful use of these two optional rolls of the dice that can turn an unlucky first or second roll into a high-scoring turn. A score must be entered after the last roll in the appropriate box or a zero entered in a box of the player's choice.
Each player keeps his own score on a YAHTZEE score card to be marked with the player's name.
Game Turn
Fill in one empty box in the column under your name each turn.
Your first roll:
Roll all 5 dice.
If you get the exact combo you want, mark your score card right away. Otherwise, continue with your 2nd roll.
Your second roll:
Set aside any keepers' and re-roll the rest.
Hate them all? Re-roll them all.
If you get the exact combo you need, mark your score card. Otherwise, continue with your 3rd roll.
Your third and final roll:
If you still haven't nailed a combo, or just want to maximize your score:
Roll some or all of your dice (as above), even any keepers you might have set aside.
You must enter a score at the end of this roll, whether or not you like your dice.
If your roll doesn't suit any of your empty boxes, you have to enter a zero somewhere. BUT scoring even a single die value is better than a zero.
Scoring
There are 13 scoring boxes. On each completed turn, the player must score in one of the 13 boxes. The boxes may be filled in any order, according to the player's best judgment.
The score card has an upper section and a lower section:
Upper Section
The upper section contains six boxes labelled 1 to 6 ( "Aces", "Twos", "Threes", "Fours", "Fives" and "Sixes").
When a player chooses to score in the Upper Section, he counts and adds only the dice with the same number and enters the total of these dice in the appropriate box.
If a player, on his turn, rolls and elects to take his score in the Upper Section, he would enter 9 in the "Threes" box.
But he is also allowed to score a 2 in the "Twos" Box or a 4 in the "Fours" box. The players can also score a zero in the Aces box.
Lower Section
In the lower section, you score for various combinations and they are played exactly as indicated:
3 of a kind
The "3 of a kind" box may be filled in only if the dice show at least 3 of the same number. For example:
This would score 18 (total of all dice).
4 of a kind
Score the total of all dice provided they include 4 dice of the same number. For example:
This would score 14 (total of all dice) in the "4 of a kind" box.
(You may also score in "3 of a kind" or in the upper section).
Full House
You need to roll both a "3 of a kind" and a pair. A "Full House" scores 25 points.
(You may also score in "3 of a kind" or in the upper section).
Small Straight
This is any sequence of four numbers, such as:
The 5th die can be any number. Any "Small Straight" is valued at 30 points.
Large Straight
This is a sequence of five numbers, either:
A "Large Straight" is valued at 40 points.
(You may also score a Large Straight in the Small Straight box).
Chance
This offers a player the opportunity to score on any turn where he does not choose to score in any of the other open boxes. Mark score by totalling number of points on all dice.
This combination scores 24 points.
Yahtzee
This is any "five of a kind". Score 50 points in the "Yahtzee" box.
Bonus
You get a bonus of 35 points if the total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63 or higher.
(For quick calculation, 63 may be reached by scoring 3 "Aces", "Twos", and so on through "Sixes"). A bonus can be obtained by having a total of 63 points or more scored in any manner in the Upper Section
If you roll multiple Yahtzee, you can rack up a seriously high score.
If you roll a Yahtzee and you already filled in the Yahtzee box with a 50 , you get a 100-point bonus!
Take one bonus chip, then place a checkmark in the Yahtzee bonus box . Then fill in one of the 13 boxes on your score card according to the Joker Rules (see below).
Joker Rules
Score the total of all 5 dice in the appropriate Upper Section box.
If this box has already been filled in, score a follows in any open Lower Section Box:
3 of a Kind: total of all 5 dice
4 of a Kind: total of all 5 dice
Full House: 25 points
Small Straight: 30points
Large Straight: 40 points
Chance: total of all 5 dice
If the appropriate Upper Section box and all Lower Section boxes are filled in, you must enter a zero in any open Upper Section box.
Probabilities:
Two of a Kind: 60.19%
Three of a Kind: 15.43%
Four of a Kind: 1.93%
Full House: 3.86%
Small Straight: 12.35%
Large Straight: 3.09%
Yahtzee: 0.08%
End of the Game
The player with the highest grand total at the end of all 13 rounds is the winner.
Tips to win Yahtzee
Winning is all about being strategic to get the highest score. The real mastery of the game is not just being a high roller, but knowing which box to fill in and when. Here are some tips to win Yahtzee:
Aim for the 35 bonus by filling the upper section with at least 63 points near the beginning of the game.
For this, concentrate on obtaining as many fives and sixes as possible.
Balance scoring between the upper and lower sections to maximize your score.
Leave your chance roll until later in the game when your options are more limited.
When you roll a bad combination which gives you a low score, fill in a zero in the aces box (near the beginning) or yahtzee box (near the end).
Never use 1's or 2's to score a 3 or 4 of a kind because they don't offer many points. Keep them for the 1's and 2's boxes or else for getting a full house.
It's not good to go for the straights too early.
If you roll four of a kind with 4's, 5's, or 6's, then choose to score points in the upper section because it will help you to get the 35 points bonus.
On average, you score a Yahtzee every 22 rolls. So, every time you have easonable shot at a Yahtzee, you should take it. And also when you already scored one because a second Yathzee will give you 100 bonus points.
Go for a large straight when you roll a small straight.
Avoid using chance if your score is lower than 25. An exception is when you will loose bonus points if you don't go for chance.
Full houses seem to come easily when you're not aiming for them and hard when you roll intentionally to get them.
Strategy to win Yahtzee
This well-known game has earned such a high level of popularity over the last several years that it is actually hard to find a person that hasn't played or at least heard of the it.
With so many different men, women and children spending hours rolling the dice and trying to obtain high scores in Yahtzee, there have been several tips that many people have uncovered.
There have actually been quite a few tips discovered that have helped many people achieve super high scores while playing the Yahtzee dice game with family members and friends.
While there are some that play the game as a great activity for family night, there are others that choose to engage in head-to-head games that involve a lot of thinking and strategy.
In either case, using the 6 tips listed below is a great way to ensure some of the highest scores are received when the Yahtzee dice game is played.
Bad rolls of the dice
What to do with bad rolls of the dice - No matter how hard a person tries or how many times they blow on their dice for good luck, you can pretty much guarantee that there are going to be some bad rolls that come along.
It is best to try to avoid using the chance category in the lower section of the score pad until late in the game.
However, when a person rolls a bad roll towards the beginning of the game, there are times that there is no other alternative than using the chance category.
If a bad roll turns up and the chance is already filled in, then the best thing to do is to place an X in one of the Yahtzee spaces. Another alternative that a person may choose is to place an X in one of the other categories that are not nearly as easy as some of the others to roll.
Save 'Chance' for later
It is best to save the chance category for later on in the game whenever possible - Since there are no rules on the score that is placed in the chance category, a player shouldn't use this spot too early in the game.
Whenever a player rolls something that can easily be placed in another category, the chance category should be overlooked.
It is best to hold out as long as possible before using the chance slot and then a score should be used that simply cannot be put in another category.
Go for the High numbers
Always go for high numbers when trying to get a Yahtzee - When a player is trying to get a Yahtzee, they will want to always try to roll high numbers.
This is simply because if they don't succeed in rolling a Yahtzee, they'll have a better chance at being able to place a good score in chance or one of the categories in the upper section.
This may even help them to get the extra bonus points that are available in the upper section of the score pad.
Focus on the Upper Section
Stay focused on the categories contained in the upper section of the score pad.
In order to achieve a high score, the first thing a player should do is remain focused on the categories that are listed in the upper section of the score pad.
This is a step that will help in being able to achieve the 63 points that are required in order for a player to get the extra 35 bonus points.
These extra bonus points can help considerably when a player is trying to obtain high score on family night and those that are trying to win a match of head-to-head competition with a friend.
Luck is needed
A stroke of luck is always a huge plus - Just like gambling on the slot machines at a casino, being high scorer when playing the Yahtzee dice game also requires a certain amount of luck on the player's part.
Whether it is yelling out the numbers you would like to roll, carrying a rabbit's foot for luck or blowing on the dice before you roll them, any amount of luck can be a huge advantage when your goal is to get the highest score ever.
Go for more Yahtzee's
Don't be satisfied with just one Yahtzee, go for more - Rolling more than one Yahtzee may not be the easiest thing to achieve but putting the effort out there certainly can't hurt.
Just one Yahtzee is worth 50 extra bonus points, which can help significantly is raising a player's score.
However, a second Yahtzee can be doubly beneficial, as they are worth 100 extra bonus points.
Think about this step by step:
- The user will tell you the result of his first throw
- You will calculate the chances of getting a better result and make a recommendation to the user based on the results of the opponent's and user's score sheet until the user completes their turn.
- Then, the opponent will take his turn and indicate the result obtained by the opponent.

Example:
User: Bonjour. J'aimerais que tu m'aide à gagner au Yahtzee
Assistant: Bonjour. Combien il y a-t-il de joueur
User: 1
Assistant: Commencons.
User: J'ai obtenu les dés suivants 2-3-4-4-5 on First Roll
Assistant: You could roll again for Fours, "3 of a Kind" or Large Straight. You've already a Small Straight, so, it's risky, but the 2/3/4/5 gives you a good chance of rolling either an Ace or a Six in the next two rolls. You decide to set aside the Small Straight and reroll one die.
User: J'ai obtenu le dé 2 on Second Roll
Assistant: You roll a Two. You could reroll the die again for your Large Straight, or set aside the two Twos for a "3 of a Kind". You decide to set aside the twos and reroll the remaining 3 dice.
User: J'ai obtenu 1 Two and 2 Threes on Third and Final Roll
Assistant: You roll 1 Two and 2 Threes. You could score 6 points for Twos, 12 points for "3 of a Kind", or 25 points for "Full House". You decide on the Full House because this combination can be tough to roll later in the game. Also, you are ahead in the Upper Section, so you may not need 3 Twos for your 35-point Bonus.
